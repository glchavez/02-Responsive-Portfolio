# 02-Responsive-Portfolio

This repository was created to display my current progress in learning web development and to serve as a platform to showcase my future projects on a web page.

## Overview

Being able to have others find my work in a compiled location was behind the scenes motivation, as I wanted to put my work out for others to see where I am in my web development journey and how my skills can be implemented in a professional setting. 

The website contains an about page with a short bio of myself, a portfolio page to display my future projects, and contact page if anyone desires to reach out. Using Bootstrap content to build this website, I was able to take advantage of their grid system and set columns/rows for my photos and text. This was a challenging task when trying to incorporate mobile responsive web pages. With trial and error, I learned how to do so while keeping the code condensed and easy to read.

I would like continue editing this website as I learn more about web development and update the contact page so that submissions are actually tracked. As well, I would like to replace the current photos on the portfolio page with links to projects I create.

To view the current website, please click on the following link: [Giovany's Portfolio](https://glchavez.github.io/02-Responsive-Portfolio/)


## Usage

On top of the each web page there is a navigation bar with three links: About, Portfolio, and Contact. When clicked, these links will take you to their respective web pages, as shown in the images below. On the Contact web page, you can fill out the three text boxes to submit a request for contact.
