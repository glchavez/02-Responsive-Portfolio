            <p class="col-md-9">Hello, my name is Giovany Chavez and I am a current non-profit worker looking to get my
                foot in the door of the web development industry. Eager to take on this transition and make a positive
                career change, I have enrolled in the Denver University coding program. Despite the difficulty of this
                program, I am excited to take on this challange!
                <br><br>
                A little background on myself, aside from my interest in web development, I am a college graduate from
                Colorado State University with a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration. A Colorado Native, I
                moved to Washington D.C. after graduating for work and enjoyed my two years in the area. Missing family
                and my home state, I have recently moved back to Colorado.
                <br><br>
                Outside of work and learning, I really enjoy outdoor activities and sports. I am also a huge beer
                enthusiast and enjoy visiting different breweries when possible. A long-term goal of mine would be to
                open up a brewery.
                <br><br>
                I hope you enjoyed reading a little about me and looking at the work I've done so far!
